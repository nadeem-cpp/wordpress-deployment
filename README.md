# Fully elastic WordPress deployment on AWS using Terraform
# AWS DevOps Infrastructure with Terraform

This project is a DevOps infrastructure as code (IaC) implementation using AWS and Terraform. It aims to create a scalable and modular AWS architecture for deploying WordPress applications with ease. The infrastructure includes the following AWS resources:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.

- **EC2 Instances**: Virtual servers for running applications and services.

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed database service for SQL databases.

- **Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changes in traffic.

- **Parameter Store**: Securely stores configuration data, secrets, and other sensitive information.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: 

    - Make sure you have AWS credentials configured on your local machine. You can set these up using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

    - Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Configuration**:

    - Modify the Terraform configuration files in the project to suit your needs. These files are typically named `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`.

3. **Deployment**:

    - Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

        ```bash
        terraform init
        ```

    - Review and apply the changes to create the infrastructure:

        ```bash
        terraform apply
        ```

    - Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes before applying them.

4. **Cleanup**:

    - To destroy the infrastructure when you're done, run:

        ```bash
        terraform destroy
        ```
